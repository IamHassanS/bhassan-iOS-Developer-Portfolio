### 👋 Hi! I'm a self-taught iOS Engineer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.


# SAN ZEN

 SAN ZEN is a powerful tool designed to streamline the work of medical representatives (MRs) by enabling them to capture and manage critical field data even without an internet connection. This app is specifically tailored for the pharmaceutical industry, offering a comprehensive solution for efficient sales force automation. MR and manager flows refer to the distinct user experiences within the SAN ZEN app tailored to the specific roles of Medical Representatives (MRs) and their managers. This is ongoing work and just a few examples of the things I've had the opportunity to work on.
